Install Instructions:

Note: Due to the size of the game, a few assets were too large to push to github so they were removed to make the process easier.
However, they can easily be re-downloaded once the inital file is open in unity. 

Steps for re-downloading asset:

1) Go to unity asset store in the unity desktop application.
 Window > Unity Asset Store

2) Search for "Windridge City"

3) Click download and then Import

4) A checklist will appear with all the individual assets to install with the folder

5) VERY IMPORTANT STEP:
   UNCHECK THE "SCENES" FOLDER (The folder with "Home_Scene" in it)
   In other words install everything else besides the scenes folder.
   This is because a Home_Scene already exists with instructions on how the game should handle the Windridge City asset and will be overriden if the new Home_Scene is installed.

6) That's it!
